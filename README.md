# Acoustic-fence

Based on [Impulse CET](https://pages.github.com/) Hackathon.

**Problem Statement:** (Scenario 1) There has been a constant rise in the number of attacks by wild animals on lands near forest or such other areas. Primarily agricultural land, which happens to be free food for the invaders.

**Task:** Propose a solution to improve the situation for those affected by such attacks.

### Wild animal attacks and existing measures

- As many as 153 farmers, including 93 tribal farmers, have cultivated paddy on 200 acres of the 250 acres of land under the **Chekadi Padashekharam, Wayanad**. Nearly 30 acres of paddy crops have been destroyed by wild animals in the last year.
- Over Rs 5 crore losses were caused within the last 18 months due to wild elephants roaming around **Aralam farm in Kannur district**, located near the Aralam wildlife sanctuary.
- Over 100 hectares of farmlands in **Tholambra, Thrikkadarippoyil, Palottuvayal, Palachippara, Sivapuram, Padupara, Alachi, Thillankeri, and Mudakkozhi areas in Puralimala valley, Kannur** is under threat of monkeys and wild boars.

##### Current prevention methods used by farmers in Kerala:

- Installing electric fences running to several kilometers on the forest borders (But the animals enter human habitats and farms after destroying them).
- Using explosives (which can cause severe injuries to wild animals leading to certain death).
- Poisoning and hunting wild animals (Which causes wildlife extinction and environmental imbalance).

### Solar Power Source:

- The FPGA board is powered by solar power.
- Most economical and renewable source of energy.
- Energy stored during day-time is used for the 24 hour real-time operation.
- Solar cells extra energy stored can be used to power up LED's setup in the farm.
